Hello Ed,

I believe Richard Simpkins may have already mentioned to you a bit about my current position in looking for jobs, but he suggested sending you an email with my CV.

I'm a recent Post graduate student from the University of Kent, where I achieved a Merit in my AI MSc. However, currently I am working as a Website Administrator for my Dad's golf retail business, completegolfer.co.uk. 

In my CV which is attached to this email, there are links to my linkedin and portfolio website. I am eager to kickstart my career as a Software Engineer, and any support or advice that you could offer would be greatly appreciated!

Kind regards,
Conor Bailey
